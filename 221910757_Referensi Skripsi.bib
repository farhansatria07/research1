abstract = {Big data has been widely spread throughout social media in this digital era. Indeed, it is a good chance for business to get the information in real time. Since the data from social media is unstructured, thus we need to process it beforehand. Machine learning needs proper training data that makes the classification model perform accurately. In order to actualize it, we need a qualified domain knowledge and the right strategy to make an optimal training data. This paper shows the strategy to make optimal training data by using customer's complaint data from Twitter. We use both Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine as classifiers. The experimental result shows that our strategy of training data optimization can give good performance for multi-class text classification model.},

abstract = {As the amount of available digital documents keeps growing rapidly, extracting useful information from them has become a major challenge. Data mining, natural language processing, and machine learning are powerful techniques that can be used together to deal with this problem. Depending on the task at hand, there are many different approaches that can be used. The methods available are continuously improved, but not all of them have been tested and compared in a set of coherent problems using supervised machine learning algorithms. For example, what happens to the quality of the methods if we increase the training data size from, say, 100 MB to over 1 GB? Moreover, are quality gains worth it when the rate of data processing diminishes? Can we trade quality for time efficiency and recover the quality loss by just being able to process more data? We attempt to answer these questions in a general way for text processing tasks, considering the trade-offs involving training data size, learning time, and quality obtained. For this, we propose a performance trade-off framework and apply it to three important tasks: Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis and Document Classification. These problems were also chosen because they have different levels of object granularity: words, paragraphs, and documents. For each problem, we selected several supervised machine learning algorithms and we evaluated the trade-offs of them on large publicly available data sets (news, reviews, patents). To explore these trade-offs, we use different data subsets of increasing size ranging from 50 MB to several GB. For the last two tasks, we also consider similar algorithms with two different data sets and two evaluation techniques, to study their impact on the resulting trade-offs. We find that the results do not change significantly and that most of the time the best algorithms are the ones with fastest processing time. However, we also show that the results for small data (say less than 100 MB) are different from the results for big data and in those cases the best algorithm is much harder to determine.},

The nature of the product appears central to many criticisms directed at marketing. There is mounting pressure on organisations to demonstrate ethical credentials. Philip Kotler highlighted the importance of taking into account a product's impact on consumers' long-term welfare. This paper extends Kotler's (1972) classification of products matrix by including ethical consideration of consumers' needs and wants. The resulting 3D matrix provides a tool for considering products from an ethical perspective. It also offers organisations and marketers a means of analysing product concepts at an early stage and of identifying directions in which an existing product for which there is a questionable need can be developed to strengthen its justification.},

abstract = {With the increase of e-commerce platforms and online applications, businessmen are looking to have a rating and review system through which they can easily reveal the feelings of customers related to their products and services. It is undeniable from the statistics that online ratings and reviews attract new customers as well as increase sales by means of providing confidence, ratification, opinions, comparisons, merchant credibility, etc. Although considerable research has been devoted to the sentiment analysis for review classification, rather less attention has been paid to the text preprocessing which is a crucial step in opinion mining especially if convenient preprocessing strategies are found out to increase the classification accuracy. In this paper, we concentrate on the impact of simple text preprocessing decisions in order to predict fine-grained review rating stars whereas the majority of previous work focused on the binary distinction of positive vs. negative. Therefore, the aim of this research is to analyze preprocessing techniques and their influence, at the same time explain the interesting observations and results on the performance of a five-class–based review rating classifier.},

abstract = {Machine Learning holds a great potential for statistical organisations. It can make the production of statistics more efficient by automating certain processes or assisting humans to carry out the processes. It also allows statistical organisations to use new types of data such as social media data and imagery. Many national and international statistical organisations are exploring how machine learning can be used to increase the relevance and the quality of official statistics in an environment of growing demands for trusted information, rapidly developing and accessible technologies, and numerous competitors. While the specific business environments may vary depending on the country, these statistical organisations face similar types of challenges which can benefit from sharing knowledge, experiences and collaborating on developing common solutions within the broad official statistical community. This publication presents the practical applications of machine learning in three working areas within statistical organisations and discusses their value added, challenges and lessons learned. It also includes a quality framework that could help guiding the choice of methods, challenges that arise when integrating machine learning into statistical production, and key steps for moving machine learning from the experimental stage to the production stage and concludes with key messages on advancing the use of machine learning for the production of official statistics. This publication is based on the results from two international initiatives: the UNECE High-Level Group on Modernisation of Official Statistics (HLG-MOS) Machine Learning Project (2019-2020) and the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics (ONS) – UNECE Machine Learning Group 2021, and approved by the HLG-MOS},

However, its random nature makes the synthesized data and even imbalanced classification results unstable. It means that in case of running SMOTE n different times, n different synthesized instances are obtained with n different classification results. To address this problem, we adapt the SMOTE idea in deep learning architecture. In this method, a deep neural network regression model is used to train the inputs and outputs of traditional SMOTE. Inputs of the proposed deep regression model are two randomly chosen data points which are concatenated to form a double size vector. The outputs of this model are corresponding randomly interpolated data points between two randomly chosen vectors with original dimension. The experimental results show that, Deep SMOTE can outperform traditional SMOTE in terms of precision, F1 score and Area Under Curve (AUC) in majority of test cases.},

One of the advantages is that e-commerce can be accessed anywhere and anytime. Despite providing advantages, e-commerce also has disadvantages including product quality fraud and data theft. Online marketplaces provide facilities for consumer evaluation, through star rating and consumer reviews. In this paper, we focus on the Business-to-Consumer (B2C) e-commerce type and extract consumer opinion data from a leading online marketplace in Indonesia and use text mining approaches to compare the rating evaluation and sentiment analysis on consumer reviews. With 2,937 records, we investigate the relationship between star rating and lexicon-based sentiment analysis. From the results, we found that most consumers do not hesitantly provide a good evaluation indicated by a 5-star rating and positive sentiment of reviews. A quite polarized rating distribution is found and indicates a straightforward consumer opinion. However, a further examination of the relation between rating and review, we discover inconsistencies in consumer opinion where the good rating may also contain negative reviews. Our result findings provide an insight to build a more integrated consumer opinion indicator in e-commerce and that online marketplace sellers need to look deeper at the detailed reviews rating.},

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

At the same time, the e-commerce industry faces serious challenges such as policy and regulation uncertainties, relatively low internet penetration, poor logistics infrastructure, low quality in human resources, and shallow digital payment penetration. Relevant authorities have enhanced regulatory efforts to ensure data protection, quality assurance, and protect local industries against unfair competition from imported products. Yet, overprotection by restricting online imports would harm both domestic consumers and micro-retail enterprises. Moving forward, the authorities will have to be adaptable and nimble in updating regulations to keep pace with the rapid advancement of digital innovation and technology.},

Recent studies have shown that poor quality data is prevalent in large databases and on the Web. Since poor quality data can have serious consequences on the results of data analyses, the importance of veracity, the fourth 'V' of big data is increasingly being recognized. In this tutorial, we highlight the substantial challenges that the first three 'V's, volume, velocity and variety, bring to dealing with veracity in big data. Due to the sheer volume and velocity of data, one needs to understand and (possibly) repair erroneous data in a scalable and timely manner. With the variety of data, often from a diversity of sources, data quality rules cannot be specified a priori; one needs to let the 'data to speak for itself' in order to discover the semantics of the data. This tutorial presents recent results that are relevant to big data quality management, focusing on the two major dimensions of (i) discovering quality issues from the data itself, and (ii) trading-off accuracy vs efficiency, and identifies a range of open problems for the community. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

Big Data provides opportunities, but in order to make optimal use of Big Data, a number of challenges have to be addressed. This stimulates increased collaboration between National Statistical Institutes, Big Data holders, businesses and universities. In time, this may lead to a shift in the role of statistical institutes in the provision of high-quality and impartial statistical information to society. In this paper, the changes in context, the opportunities, the challenges and the way to collaborate are addressed. The collaboration between the various stakeholders will involve each partner building on and contributing different strengths. For national statistical offices, traditional strengths include, on the one hand, the ability to collect data and combine data sources with statistical products and, on the other hand, their focus on quality, transparency and sound methodology. In the Big Data era of competing and multiplying data sources, they continue to have a unique knowledge of official statistical production methods. And their impartiality and respect for privacy as enshrined in law uniquely position them as a trusted third party. Based on this, they may advise on the quality and validity of information of various sources. By thus positioning themselves, they will be able to play their role as key information providers in a changing society.},

Machine learning and statistical analysis results are highly dependent on data preprocessing tasks. The purpose of data preprocessing is to revert the data to a format capable for the analysis and to ensure the high quality of data. However, not only management aspects for unstructured or semi-structured data remain largely unexplored but also new preprocessing techniques are required for addressing big data. In this chapter, the data preprocessing stages for big data sources emphasizing on online social networks are investigated. Special attention is paid to practical questions regarding low-quality data including incomplete, imbalanced, and noisy data. Furthermore, challenges and potential solutions of statistical and rule-based analysis for data cleansing are overviewed. The contribution of natural language processing, feature engineering, and machine learning methods is explored. Online social networks are investigated as (i) context, (ii) analysis practices, (iii) low-quality data, and most importantly (iv) how the latter are being addressed by techniques and frameworks. Last but not least, preprocessing on the broader field of distributed infrastructures is briefly overviewed.},
